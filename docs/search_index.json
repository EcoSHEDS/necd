Walker, Kyle O’Neil, Benjamin Letcher Updated: 2022-07-21 Section 1 Introduction The EcoSHEDS Northeast Catchment Delineation (NECD)1 is a high resolution catchment delineation of the northeast U.S. It was created in 2015 by Kyle O’Neil to support the EcoSHEDS northeast stream temperature and brook trout occupancy models. In addition to the flowlines and catchment polygons, NECD includes a number of additional data products created to support the EcoSHEDS northeast stream temperature and brook trout occupancy models such as landscape and climate metrics as well as zones of impoundment and tidal influence. This dataset was developed as part of the EcoSHEDS project. NECD includes the following data products: Catchment Delineation Basin Characteristics Daymet Impoundment Influence Zones Tidal Influence Zones Downloads contains a list of all available data products. Source code is available at EcoSHEDS/necd. NECD was formerly called the National Hydrography Dataset High Resolution Delineation Version 2 (NHDHRDV2). It has been renamed to avoid confusion with the USGS NHDPlus High Resolution (HR) dataset, which was not yet available when this dataset was created.↩︎ "],["catchment-delineation.html", "Section 2 Catchment Delineation", " Section 2 Catchment Delineation Work in progress… "],["basin-characteristics.html", "Section 3 Basin Characteristics", " Section 3 Basin Characteristics Work in progress… "],["daymet.html", "Section 4 Daymet", " Section 4 Daymet Work in progress… "],["impoundment-influence-zones.html", "Section 5 Impoundment Influence Zones", " Section 5 Impoundment Influence Zones Work in progress… "],["tidal-influence-zones.html", "Section 6 Tidal Influence Zones", " Section 6 Tidal Influence Zones Work in progress… "],["downloads.html", "Section 7 Downloads", " Section 7 Downloads Work in progress… "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
