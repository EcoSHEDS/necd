Walker, Kyle O’Neil, Benjamin Letcher Updated: 2022-07-22 Section 1 Introduction The EcoSHEDS Northeast Catchment Delineation (NECD)1 is a high resolution catchment delineation of the northeast U.S. It was created in 2015 by Kyle O’Neil to support the EcoSHEDS northeast stream temperature and brook trout occupancy models. In addition to the flowlines and catchment polygons, NECD includes a number of additional data products created to support the EcoSHEDS northeast stream temperature and brook trout occupancy models such as landscape and climate metrics as well as zones of impoundment and tidal influence. This dataset was developed as part of the EcoSHEDS project. NECD includes the following data products: Catchment Delineation Basin Characteristics Impoundment Influence Zones Tidal Influence Zones Downloads contains a list of all available data products. Source code is available at EcoSHEDS/necd. NECD was formerly called the National Hydrography Dataset High Resolution Delineation Version 2 (NHDHRDV2). It has been renamed to avoid confusion with the USGS NHDPlus High Resolution (HR) dataset, which was not yet available when this dataset was created.↩︎ "],["catchment-delineation.html", "Section 2 Catchment Delineation", " Section 2 Catchment Delineation Catchment Delineation The EcoSHEDS Northeast Catchment Delineation (NECD) is a series of geospatial layers representing hydrologic catchments and flowlines spanning the northeast region of the United States. The NECD sought to address specific aspects of the national hydrography products that were available at the time this delineation was created. Specifically, improved spatial resolution and consistency were the focus of the development of NECD. Another goal of this product was to capture small headwater streams omitted by existing products such as the medium resolution catchments in NHDPlus Version 2. Representing these streams can be critical to understanding key ecological interests. Closer Look at Catchment Delineation The NECD catchment delineation process was based on NHD high resolution flowlines and a 30m resolution digital elevation model (DEM). At the time it was developed, there were no large scale catchment products derived from these flowlines2. By using the NHD flowlines, the NECD data products include attribute fields indicating routing paths, which can be used to establish the network structure. The data products include two sets of flowlines: detailed and truncated. The detailed flowlines are the NHD high resolution flowlines that served as the starting point for this delineation. The truncated flowlines are a subset of the detailed flowlines that only include stream segments with a drainage area of more than 0.75 km2. The truncated flowlines were then used to delineate the individual catchments. This truncation process was used to ensure consistency in the spatial resolution of the flowlines across the entire region. In both the catchment and flowline layers, the FEATUREID attribute is used as the unique ID assigned to each catchment. More details about the motivation and methodology used to develop the NECD data products as well as definitions of each attribute field are provided in the documentation: Documentation: EcoSHEDS NECD Catchment Delineation Documentation.docx Downloads: the NECD shapefiles are available for download in pre-staged HUC2 regions (see map below for region boundaries) spatial_01.zip: Region 01 spatial_02.zip: Region 02 spatial_03.zip: Region 03 spatial_04.zip: Region 04 spatial_05.zip: Region 05 spatial_06.zip: Region 06 Each zip file contains the following shapefiles: Catchments##.shp: catchment polygons detailedFlowlines##.shp: detailed flowlines (from NHD) truncatedFlowlines##.shp: truncated flowlines (drainage area &gt;= 0.75 km2) regionboundary##.shp: region boundary Region Boundaries The NHDPlus High Resolution (HR) dataset now provides delineated catchments, but these were not available when NECD was developed↩︎ "],["basin-characteristics.html", "Section 3 Basin Characteristics", " Section 3 Basin Characteristics The basin characteristics (aka covariates) dataset provides a variety of landscape metrics associated with the NECD catchments.

Currently, only a 100m influence zone has been generated. A shapefile of dam locations were used from the UMass Designing Sustainable Landscapes (DSL) Project version of The Nature Conservancy’s dam inventory with locations snapped to the NHD high resolution flowlines. The impoundment influence zones are used to identify stream temperature monitoring sites that are potentially influenced by upstream impoundments.
