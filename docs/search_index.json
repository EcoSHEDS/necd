Walker, Kyle O’Neil, Benjamin Letcher Updated: 2022-07-21 Section 1 Introduction The EcoSHEDS Northeast Catchment Delineation (NECD)1 is a high resolution catchment delineation of the northeast U.S. It was created in 2015 by Kyle O’Neil to support the EcoSHEDS northeast stream temperature and brook trout occupancy models. In addition to the flowlines and catchment polygons, NECD includes a number of additional data products created to support the EcoSHEDS northeast stream temperature and brook trout occupancy models such as landscape and climate metrics as well as zones of impoundment and tidal influence. This dataset was developed as part of the EcoSHEDS project. NECD includes the following data products: Catchment Delineation Basin Characteristics Impoundment Influence Zones Tidal Influence Zones Downloads contains a list of all available data products. Source code is available at EcoSHEDS/necd. NECD was formerly called the National Hydrography Dataset High Resolution Delineation Version 2 (NHDHRDV2). It has been renamed to avoid confusion with the USGS NHDPlus High Resolution (HR) dataset, which was not yet available when this dataset was created.↩︎ "],["catchment-delineation.html", "Section 2 Catchment Delineation", " Section 2 Catchment Delineation Work in progress… "],["basin-characteristics.html", "Section 3 Basin Characteristics", " Section 3 Basin Characteristics Work in progress… "],["impoundment-influence-zones.html", "Section 4 Impoundment Influence Zones", " Section 4 Impoundment Influence Zones Impoundment Influence Zones The impoundment influence zones layer was created using a network analysis methodology that maps a user-specified length downstream from an impoundment. Currently, only a 100m influence zone has been generated. A shapefile of dam locations were used from the UMass Designing Sustainable Landscapes (DSL) Project version of The Nature Conservancy’s dam inventory with locations snapped to the NHD high resolution flowlines. The impoundment influence zones are used to identify stream temperature monitoring sites that are potentially influenced by upstream impoundments.

All of the polygons that have any form of tidal influence as defined by the NWI Wetlands and Deepwater Map Code Diagram were indexed. The polygons were joined together and exported to a single shapefile representing all bodies of water that are impacted by tides within the EcoSHEDS NECD range. This layer is used to identify stream temperature monitoring sites that are potentially influenced by tides.
