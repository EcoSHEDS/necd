Create Stream Layer
===================
6. Define streams based on a minimum drainage area. These streams will be used to trim the high resolution streams and improve resolution consistency.
ArcHydro Tools > Terrain Processing > Stream Definition
Flow Accumulation Grid: Fac01
Number of Cells: 833
Area (square km): 0.75
Stream Grid: Str01

7. Convert the high resolution streams to raster format. This layer will be trimmed to a defined threshold. 
Conversion Tools > To Raster > Polyline To Raster
Input Features: delineationStreams01
Value Field: rasterVal (= 1)
Output Raster Dataset: StrHR01
Call assignment type: MAXIMUM_LENGTH
Priority Field: None
Cell Size: Same as "Str01"
Environments: Set snap raster to "Str01"

8. Trim the high resolution stream grid to the defined stream threshold by masking the latter with the former.
Spatial Analyst Tools > Extraction > Extract by mask
Input raster: Str01
Input raster or feature mask data: StrHR01
Output Raster: StrTrunc01

9. Segment Streams
Segment the streams at confluences for network definition.
ArcHydro Tools > Terrain Processing > Stream Segmentation
Flow Direction Grid: Fdr01
Stream Grid: StrTrunc01
Sink Watershed Grid: Null
Sink Link Grid: Null
Stream Link Grid: StrLnk01

10. Create the flowline layer for initial inspection.
ArcHydro Tools > Terrain Processing > Drainage Line Processing
Stream Link Grid: StrLnk01
Flow Direction Grid: Fdr01
Drainage Line: DrainageLine01

11. Edit Network Breaks
Errors in the raw high resolution flowlines can result in breaks in the network. The streams layer from UMass has taken care of most of these issues, so the edits should mostly come in the area of raw NHDH flowlines.
These are discovered by performing a Select By Attributes on DrainageLine01 where: NextDownID = -1.
Export these selected stream segments and compare with the original "streams01" layer. The "streams01" layer is manually edited to either connect or remove the stream segments that cause these breaks in the network. 
The edited layer is saved as "streamsCleaned01". A new folder structure and map are set up and the process is begun again from the first step. This time, the edited streams are used in place of the originals.

**** The "RasterVal" column needs to be recalculated whenever new features are added to a streams layer


Remove False Headwaters
=======================
Converting the high resolution streams to grid format creates orthogonal cells. These cells are interpreted as new streams which are false headwater streams.
These streams need to be removed from the network.


12. Mark False Headwaters
Determine the false headwater streams using the R script that checks segment length and whether or not it is a headwater. Headwater streams that are 45 meters or shorter are marked.
Export DrainageLine01 Table as a DBF
Run indexFalseHeadwaters.R on this DBF
Join the output table (DrainageLine01_FalseHeadwaters.dbf) back to DrainageLine01 by the "HydroID" field



A. Remove streams by polyline editing

12. Edit Flowlines
Open the DrainageLine01 attribute table and Select by Attributes: remove = 0  ("DrainageLine01_FalseHeadwaters.remove" = 0)
Export the selected features as DrainageLineTrimHW01




13. Rasterize New Flowlines
Convert the edited flowlines to grid format.
Conversion Tools > To Raster > Polyline To Raster
Input Features: DrainageLineTrimHW01
Value Field: rasterVal (= 1)
Output Raster Dataset: StrTrimHW01
Cell assignment type: MAXIMUM_LENGTH
Priority Field: None
Cell Size: Same as "StrTrunc01"
Environments: Set snap raster to "StrTrunc01"

14: Trim New Flowlines 
Rasterizing the new flowlines creates some extra cells that did not exist in the original layer (StrTrunc01). Trimming the new stream grid to the old removes these. 
Spatial Analyst Tools > Extraction > Extract by mask
Input raster: StrTrimHW01
Input raster or feature mask data: StrTrunc01
Output Raster: StrFixHW01

B. Remove streams by raster cells
Some cells representing false headwaters persist through the previous removal process. These remaining cells are removed by rasterizing the headwaters to mask these cells.

15. Identify False Headwaters
Open the DrainageLineRaw01 attribute table and Select by Attributes: remove = 1 ("DrainageLine01_FalseHeadwaters.remove" = 1)
Export the selected features as FalseHeadwaters01

16. Convert False Headwaters to Points
The false headwater lines are converted to points for rasterization. Since these segments have a maximum length of the cell diagonal, the points fall in the correct cell they will represent.
Data Management Tools > Features > Feature to Point
Input Features: FalseHeadwaters01
Output Feature Class: FalseHeadwatersPts01
Inside: Checked

17. Convert False Headwater Points to Raster
The false headwaters are converted to raster cells for correcting the new stream grid.
Conversion Tools > To Raster > Point To Raster
Input Features: FalseHeadwatersPts01
Value Field: rasterVal (= 1)
Output Raster Dataset: FalseHWPts01
Call assignment type: MOST_FREQUENT
Priority Field: None
Cell Size: Same as "StrFixHW01"
Environments: Set snap raster to "StrFixHW01"

18. Remove Remaining Headwater Cells
Use the Raster Calculator to remove the remaining false headwater cells from the new stream grid layer.
Spatial Analyst Tools > Map Algebra > Raster Calculator
Map Algebra Expression: SetNull(~(IsNull("FalseHWPts01")),"StrFixHW01")
OutputRaster: StrFinal01
Environments: Set processing extent to "StrFixHW01"

19. Segment Streams
Segment the streams at confluences for network definition.
ArcHydro Tools > Terrain Processing > Stream Segmentation
Flow Direction Grid: Fdr01
Stream Grid: StrFinal01
Sink Watershed Grid: Null
Sink Link Grid: Null
Stream Link Grid: StrLnkFinal01

20. Create New Drainage Lines
Create the drainage lines from the new segmented streams. These streams should have all false headwaters removed. 
ArcHydro Tools > Terrain Processing > Drainage Line Processing
Stream Link Grid: StrLnkFinal01
Flow Direction Grid: Fdr01
Drainage Line: DrainageLineFinal01

Check that all of the false headwaters have been removed by using the "indexFalseHeadwaters" R script on the new attribute table.
In some cases, a few false headwaters may still exist. If this is the case, then manually adjust the points to fall into the correct cells and iterate again through steps 17-20
Also check to see if these steps created any network breaks. If so, correct the false headwater points and iterate through steps 17-20.

Delete: FalseHWPts01, StrFinal01, StrLnkFinal01, DrainageLineFinal01, DrainageLineFinal01.dbf


Delineate Catchments
====================
21. Delineate Catchment Grid
ArcHydro Tools > Terrain Processing > Catchment Grid Delineation
Flow Direction Grid: Fdr01
Link Grid: StrLnkFinal01
Catchment Grid: Cat01

22. Convert Catchment Grid to Polygons
ArcHydro Tools > Terrain Processing > Catchment Polygon Processing
Catchment Grid: cat01
Catchment: Catchment01

### Need to figure out how to split up the HUC regions. Options:

 - Use the boundary and call that it.
 - Buffer the delineation and select by flowlines







Manually check network
======================


Options: 


1) Just edit the DrainageLine and Catchment features. This will make further working with layers difficult in cases of diverted flow (e.g. reservoirs) 




2) Edit str (stream raster) layers. In order to work with the flow direction/flow accumulation layer this might require ignoring diversions in the case of reservoirs.







Addressed errors
================
> False headwater streams created
> NextdownID = -1 in middle of network

Existing Errors
===============













14. Terrain Processing > Adjoint Catchment Processing
Drainage Line: DrainageLine01
Catchment: Catchment01
Adjoint Catchment: AdjointCatchment01




# This process worked fairly well. There are a few errors where NextDownID = -1 in the middle of a basin.

Str segments align with strHR segments from a different branch. Can go through manually and delete the areas where there are tiny, disjointed segments.

** Check the areas where these errors occur. Some changes done by UMass to the raw flowlines seem to be problematic (streams crossing through hills). 
		Maybe it was an earlier version of the high res flowlines that caused this
