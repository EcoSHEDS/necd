The "hydroPoliticalBoundary01" layer was created by combining the "hydroBoundary01" with the overlapping poltical boundaries. 
The primary purpose of the political boundaries was to establish the coastline boundary to be clipped from the DEM.
This process will be unique to each hydro zone so it is not scripted out.


Being with: 
Political boundary shapefiles
Canada Provinces -  http://www.nws.noaa.gov/geodata/catalog/national/html/province.htm
United States - http://nationalatlas.gov/atlasftp-1m.html
New Brunswick - http://www.snb.ca/geonb1/e/DC/catalogue-E.asp

Hydro region polygon
"hydroBoundary01" - created by the script: "createHydroBoundary.py"


Processing steps:

1) Project all of the files to the same projection as "hydroBoundary01".
2) Select just the Quebec province from the Canada province shapefile and export as a new layer.
3) Select all of the state polygons that overlap the hydro region and export as a new layer.
4) Use the "Union" tool to combine the political boundaries (New Brunswick, Quebec, and states).
5) Dissolve the result of the union (allow multipart features).
6) Manually edit the result of the dissolve to remove the holes created along the border between the US and Canada.
7) Clip this politcal boundary to the hydro region boundary ("hydroBoundary01"). The result is the "hydroPoliticalBoundary01" layer.

buffer the hydro boundary by 5km
clip the buffered file to the political boundary. This step creates the shoreline boundary, while maintaining a buffer on the inland watershed boundary for establishing the natural boundary through delineation.
