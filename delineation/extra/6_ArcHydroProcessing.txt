If this workflow doesn't resolve dead-end issues, then try re-burning streams into "FillSink:

>>>> Make sure to set ArcHydro layers paths before starting <<<


1. Terrain Processing > DEM Manipulation > Level DEM
Raw DEM: dem01
Lake Polygon: waterbodies01
Fill Elevation: None
Level DWM: LevelDEM01

Catchment Grid: cat01
Catchment: Catchment01

13. Terrain Processing > Drainage Line Processing

##### Remove False Headwater Streams ######


13. Terrain Processing > Drainage Line Processing
Stream Link Grid: StrLnk01
Flow Direction Grid: Fdr01
Drainage Line: DrainageLineRaw01


Remove false headwater streams from polyline (DrainageLineRaw01) - 
Export DrainageLineRaw01 Table as a DBF
Run indexFalseHeadwaters.R on this DBF
Join the output table from this back to DrainageLineRaw01

Select the features from DrainageLineRaw01 where remove = 0
Export these as DrainageLineTrim01

Polyline to Raster










Rasterize these
Clip these to the StrTrunc01














14. Terrain Processing > Adjoint Catchment Processing
Drainage Line: DrainageLine01
Catchment: Catchment01
Adjoint Catchment: AdjointCatchment01




# This process worked fairly well. There are a few errors where NextDownID = -1 in the middle of a basin.

Str segments align with strHR segments from a different branch. Can go through manually and delete the areas where there are tiny, disjointed segments.

** Check the areas where these errors occur. Some changes done by UMass to the raw flowlines seem to be problematic (streams crossing through hills). 
		Maybe it was an earlier version of the high res flowlines that caused this

6. Terrain Processing > DEM Manipulation > Create Drainage Line Structures
Raw DEM: LevelDEM
Stream: flowlines01
Stream Flow Direction Grid: FdrStr
Stream Link Grid: StrLnkAdj
Drainage Line: DrainageLineAdj
Clear Right Angles: Unchecked
Use Raster Extent: Unchecked

Notes: 
	> Stream layer needs to have HydroID column
	> Don't use Stream Link Grid or Drainage Line created from this step
	> It would be better to use the corrected flowlines here
	
7. Terrain Processing > Adjust Flow Direction in Streams
